Putin was riding a bear. I came. I saw something spectacular.
I had never witnessed a Russian president before and it put me
to tears. Oh lord! Putin is the most awesome president I have ever seen! He 
is my hero! 
I was going to greet him and shake his hands to express my love for him. How can I be a great president as Putin?
By drinking Vodka and riding bears.
